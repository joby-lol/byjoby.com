# A long (but not exhaustive) list of who is in on the round Earth conspiracy

To make a quick point, this is a list of people who in their day to day work must account for the spin and/or curvature of the Earth. To successfully hide the flatness of the planet, every single one of the people in every single one of these professions must be in on it.

* Sailors
* Pilots
* Most of the Air Force and Navy, actually
* Astronauts
* Balloonists
* Geologists
* Astronomers
* Meteorologists
* Climatologists
* Precise timekeeping organizations (NIST, et al)
* Fossil fuel pipeline engineers
* Structural engineers
* Surveyors
* Civil engineers
* Farmers
* Telecom companies
* National space agencies
* Private space agencies
* Airline companies
* Shipping companies
* Cruise ships
* Manufacturers of GPS chips
* Every member of every military who plans global troop movements
* Artillery gunners
* ...

Also all the instructors for the training that all these people go though are really working overtime. They're constructing two entire curricula, one for posting publicly, which acknowledges the curvature of the Earth, and then another entire one where they teach these people how to *actually* do their jobs while maintaining the round-Earth facade.

The list really goes on and on and on. To encompass a not-insignificant fraction of the people in the world, it must be one *hell* of a conspiracy.

Of course, on the other hand...
