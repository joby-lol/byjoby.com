# How a stranger let me into his email

I bought a used Surface Pro 3 last week. Normally when you sell a device you factory reset it, and send it in the freshly wiped state. Windows 10 even has a factory reset that repeatedly over-writes the whole drive to fully remove all traces of your files.

Not this silly, gentle, trusting soul. Instead, he sent it to me with his account still set up. Then he emailed me his password. **I shit you not.**

I thought, OK, this is goofy, but whatever. *Certainly* he at least deleted his account, and created a new empty one to pass off to the device's new owner. There's no way he left it **signed in to his Google account.**

So I sign in, and ... Not only is the thing still signed in to his Gmail account, but he has Chrome sync signed in too. I can see what he's been doing on his computer at home while this one was in the mail! Turns out he likes pictures of Transformers and watches a lot of Netflix. But I digress.

I think he didn't wipe it because there was something borked in the recovery partition. I wasn't planning on using that anyway though. A fresh install -- nuking it from orbit -- is the only way to be sure (sure enough for my purposes anyway).

## PSA: Wipe your devices!

If you're selling a device, *please, please, please* wipe it first. If this guy had sent it to a less kindly person he could have wound up trolled *so badly* -- if he was lucky. He dodged a bullet selling it to somebody like me.

The rest of you, don't do that.
