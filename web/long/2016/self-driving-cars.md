# On the ethics of self-driving cars

I’ve never been swayed by the supposed ethical impossibility of self-driving cars. So we now get to sit down and think at length about how to best handle these ethical dilemmas? And that’s somehow worse than letting them get solved _without_ thought by our dumb monkey brain reflexes? Sure it will be hard, and it will probably even be very uncomfortable at times. But it’s ultimately a chance to greatly_advance_ the ethics of car crashes. Just because we currently make these decisions without thinking about them doesn’t make what ultimately happens _ethical._ It makes them easier to excuse when they're terrible, but that's a far cry from actually ethical.

I also don’t buy the argument that automating cars will destroy the economy. Automating all kinds of things could destroy the economy. The downfall of this particular economic paradigm isn’t really the point though. Our current 40-hour workweek is entirely a cultural and governmental construct. We can change it if we want to, and as more and more automation continues to chip away at the base labor required to run a society? We’re going to find that we _have to._ As a society I think we need to dramatically re-think our relationship with work, and fear of self-driving cars is just one facet of that issue. But that’s a discussion for another day.

What I’m most excited about when it comes to self-driving cars is what they’ll _enable,_ not what they’ll break. When I read [_Rainbow’s End by Vernor Vinge_][1] (which I can't recommend enough, I might add) I remember being most compelled by its vision of a future where autonomous cars are public transportation. We could live in a world where instead of all owning our own cars, there are massive fleets of autonomous cars. Its vision does away with lines on the road, signs, stoplights, and all the other signalling and traffic control infrastructure designed for humans.

Such a system also frees those who can’t drive (or can’t afford to drive) from an enormous amount of inequity. The blind can get to work just as fast and in just as much comfort as anyone else. People who work in a different part of town than everyone else don’t get screwed by under-supported bus networks. You don’t have to wait outside your work for 20 minutes before your shift starts just because that’s when the train is scheduled.

I haven’t even had a chance to get into the sheer space we could save. Right now my car spends under an hour a week actually doing anything. The rest of the time it just sits there, taking up the 153 square feet that is a standard Albuquerque parking space, and is occasionally slept in by a homeless person if I forget to lock it.

Most cars are similar, and spend easily 90% of their time sitting around taking up space. Imagine what we could do with all the parking lots if cars instead spent 90% of their time on the road, and parked themselves on the outskirts of town when nobody needed them. We could take the huge portion of our land that is parking lots and build houses on it, and turn it into actual parks, and have cities that are made for humans instead of cars.

I think the most interesting thing self-driving cars could change about cities is...kind of __everything.__ If we really embrace them they could change the world as much or more than dumb cars did, but in a less dumb direction.
