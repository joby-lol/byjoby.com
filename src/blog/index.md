# Blog-like assembly

This is a collection of things I've written, collected and organized so that they are mostly in chronological order.

## 2016
* [Tay, racist AI, and the limitations of geeks](2016/tay.html)
* [On the ethics of self-driving cars](2016/self-driving-cars.html)
* [How a stranger handed me the keys to his Google account](2016/wipe-your-devices)
* [Building a better web](2016/better-web)

## Relics

This is where I pile older stuff that I didn't know what to do with.

* [Canvas fingerprinting demo](relics/canvas-fingerprinting)
* [Sandpile models](relics/sandpiles)
