<p>I bought a used Surface Pro 3 last week. Normally when you sell a device you factory reset it, and send it in the freshly wiped state. Windows 10 even has a factory reset that repeatedly over-writes the whole drive to fully remove all traces of your files.</p>
<figure><br><img src="emailed-password.jpg"><br><figcaption><br>This is not the generally though of as a &quot;good&quot; way of transferring ownership of a computer.<br></figcaption><br></figure>

<p>Not this silly, gentle, trusting soul. Instead, he sent it to me with his account still set up. Then he emailed me his password. <strong>I shit you not.</strong></p>
<p>I thought, OK, this is goofy, but whatever. <em>Certainly</em> he at least deleted his account, and created a new empty one to pass off to the device&#39;s new owner. There&#39;s no way he left it <strong>signed in to his Google account.</strong></p>

<p>So I sign in, and ... Not only is the thing still signed in to his Gmail account, but he has Chrome sync signed in too. I can see what he&#39;s been doing on his computer at home while this one was in the mail! Turns out he likes pictures of Transformers and watches a lot of Netflix. But I digress.</p>
<p>I think he didn&#39;t wipe it because there was something borked in the recovery partition. I wasn&#39;t planning on using that anyway though. A fresh install -- nuking it from orbit -- is the only way to be sure (sure enough for my purposes anyway).</p>
<h2 id="psa-wipe-your-devices-">PSA: Wipe your devices!</h2>
<p>If you&#39;re selling a device, <em>please, please, please</em> wipe it first. If this guy had sent it to a less kindly person he could have wound up trolled <em>so badly</em> -- if he was lucky. He dodged a bullet selling it to somebody like me.</p>
<p>The rest of you, don&#39;t do that.</p>
