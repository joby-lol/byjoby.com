            This is a picture of me when I met George R. R. Martin. Rendered in a nice, semantic, standards-compliant &lt;figure&gt; tag.

        This page is being generated through a whole chain of medium-complicated stuff!
        Whether that is good or not is up for debate.
        I, of all people, should be bothered by this complexity.
        Few things are as important to me as the democratization of the web.
        To that end, no HTML, CSS or Javascript <em>(lol)</em> on this site will ever be <strike>minified</strike> <em>uglified</em>.
    View source to your heart's content, and then go out and build your own!
    Together we can break the silos and build a free-er, more durable, more interesting, and just plain weirder and more wonderful web.

    In any event, my name is Joby.
    I'm a web developer, artist, graphic designer, and computer science student at the University of New Mexico.
    This is my little slice of the internet.
    I honestly don't entirely know what it's for, but I do know that it's mine.

<h2>Idea can</h2>
<p>
    I've got a fair number of ideas rattling around.
    Check back at some point if any of them interest you.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong><em>Actually</em> easy guide to building a website.</strong> Installing Wordpress is easy...I guess. But for a lot of regular non-technical people it's still too much. Never mind maintaining that gigantic, constantly-patching, target on your back that it actually is. And when they inevitably get hacked? Might as well just die. The thing is though, that it really is possible for a regular person to buy a cheap web hosting account and build a decent site with SSI, and have a pretty legit web presence that is speedy and secure.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Contact me</h2>
<p>
    If you're a stranger your best bet for getting in touch is to hit up my <a href="/links/gplus">Google+ account</a>.
    Despite my vaguely illustrious 1,400-ish followers I have notifications on, so if you mention me I'll see it.
